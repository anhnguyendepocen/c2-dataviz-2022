# Agenda 

* *git* vs GitHub vs GitKraken

* Two ways to create a repo

* Adding collaborators

* Branching

* Pull requests

* Forking

* Stashing

* General recommendations

---
# Setup

I'm assuming you're all setup. If not, please do the following

* [Download and install](https://git-scm.com/downloads) *git*

* [Register](https://github.com) for a GitHub account

* [Download and install](https://www.gitkraken.com/download) GitKraken


---
# *git* vs GitHub

*git* and GitHub are somewhat analogous to R and RStudio 

* R is the "engine", RStudio is the IDE
* *git* is the "engine", GitHub is the web-based hosting service


--
It's somewhat easy to conflate these things, but it's important to keep them separate... Why?

# GitKraken
A visual interface for interacting with *git*

---
# Why GitKraken

You could argue it would be better to focus on the command line interface. 

--
## My experience

--
Most people have an easier time grasping the *concepts* of *git* (like branching) when there's a visual interface


--
GitKraken allows you to do 95%+ of the work you need to do without moving to the CLI

---
# Why GitKraken

If you decide to go with CLI eventually, that's totally fine. You'll probably need to for some operations. But as Jenny Bryan notes

> No one is giving out Git Nerd merit badges


--

So use the tools that make you most effective

# Big picture

### Why do we use *git*?

---
# We use *git* to:

* Contain version control and track changes to documents over time


--
* Increase transparency and reproducibilty in process


--
* Collaborate with others efficiently and effectively

--
* Share our work with others

# Warning
This will be painful at times - you've probably already had painful experiences. I believe the payoff is worth the effort.

The vocabulary is probably half the battle

## Creating repositories: Starting with an empty project

---
# GitHub first

If you are starting a new project and you're going to use version control, I suggest going GitHub first

--
* Create a new empty repo on Github

* Clone the repo locally

* Start your project (i.e., [RStudio Projects](https://rstudio.com/resources/webinars/managing-part-1-projects-in-rstudio/))

* Commit your initial changes

* Push the changes to the remote

## Creating repositories: Starting with an existing project

---
# Project first

If you already have an existing project, you need to:

* Initialize the repo locally

* Create an empty repo on GitHub

* Connect your local repo to the remote

# Vocabulary pop quiz

### What do the following mean?

* Stage

* Commit

* Push

* Pull

* Clone

* Branch

* Fork

---
# Merge conflicts

* Merge conflicts only occur if you try to edit *the same line* of an out-of-date file

* Let's create and resolve one with the README file.

---
# Branching

Super powerful approach to collaborating with *git*. Essentially create a copy of the repo at a given point.

* Create and *checkout* a new branch.

* Make changes and commits *on the branch*, which frees you up to play and experiment without fear of "breaking" the main branch

* Push the branch to the remote

* When you're ready, submit a *pull request* to merge the branch with the main branch

* Note - any changes on the branch *will not be visible* if you don't have that branch checked out

---

# [demo]


---
# Pull requests
Submit a PR for a branch when you're ready

Consider tagging others to review the changes before they are merged in

Link the PR to any relevant [Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Consider adding labels (e.g., bug fix, enhancement)

# [demo]

# Forking

Similar process to branching, with a few major differences:

* You don't have to be (and shouldn't be) a direct collaborator

* You copy the entire repo *to your account*

  + You can then make whatever changes you want and push the changes to your fork
  
* If you want your changes implemented, you *must* submit a pull request (you can't contribute to the repo directly unless you're a collaborator) and *compare across forks*


---
# Stashing

### Last topic for the day

When working across multiple branches, you might find yourself occassionally making edits on the wrong branch

You can't commit those changes, but you don't want to lose them either

Stashing allows you to basically create a temporary branch, store the changes there, then "pop" them on the correct branch

# General advice

* Create a repo

* Add collaborators

* Always pull before starting new work

* Always commit all changes before finishing your work
  + If you don't do this, you might end up with automatic stashing

* File Issues to track work that should be completed
	- Include assignments for individuals
	- Tag issues to help with organization

---
# General advice
* Use branches to create new changes
  + A good rule of thumb - one branch for each issue
  
* Submit pull requests when the work on a given branch is complete, and link it to the corresponding issue
	- Tag collaborators to review the pull request
	- Use GitHub's review resources to comment on individual lines of code, as needed
	- Use the PR to have conversations about the changes and any revisions needed

---
# General advice

* Merge pull requests and delete the remote branch
	- Move back to your local, checkout the main branch, pull the merged changes, delete the local branch
