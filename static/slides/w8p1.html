  + create a table
  + format columns
  + create spanner heads
  + etc.
* Understand how to use additional fonts (if you so choose)

# Overview
* Pipe-oriented

* Beautiful tables easy

* Spanner heads/grouping used to be a total pain - not so anymore

* Renders to HTML/PDF without even thinking about it

--

Probably my favorite package for creating static tables, although [**kableExtra**](https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/) is great too.

My experience is that fewer people are generally familiar with [**gt**](https://gt.rstudio.com), which is why I cover it here.

---
# Install


```r
install.packages("gt")

# or

remotes::install_github("rstudio/gt")
```

---
# The hard part
* Getting your data in the format you want a table in

* Utilize your `pivot_*` skills regularly


```r
library(fivethirtyeight)

```

Idea of today is not to teach you everything, but to give you an idea of what's
possible. Check out the [documentation]() for more information.

# Fonts

---
# General advice
* Use different fonts to distinguish things 
    + Specifically code
    + Consider different fonts for different heading levels, and/or to distinguish headers from the body

* .bolder[Always] choose a sans-serif font for code

* Explore and try - it makes a big impact on the overall look/feel (bigger than
you may expect if you haven't played with fonts much before)

* Try not to get sucked into too deep of a rabbit hole

# {ragg}

*Brand* new pacakge - just learning about it myself.

Alternative device to Cairo, png, etc.

See the announcement [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/02/modern-text-features/)

After install, be sure to set *Global Options &gt; General &gt; Graphics* to *AGG*

Use with RMarkdown with `knitr::opts_chunk$set(dev = "ragg_png")`

Will automatically detect fonts you have installed on your computer

# Quick aside
### Change the font of your R Markdown!

Create a CSS code chunk - write tiny bit of CSS - voila!


```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Akronim&amp;display=swap');

body {
  font-family: 'Akronim', cursive;
}
```


---
# Render!

# Aside

I actually did this for these slides to make the tables a bit smaller!

# Resource for learning more
* I'm not an expert on fonts. I have mostly just picked what looks nice to me.

# Identify fonts

Use others work to help you - I found the font for these slides from a different theme that I liked.

Use google chrome's developer tools to help!
