# Learning Objectives
* Understand some of the basics of pattern matching for strings

* Understand how decisions you make with your visualizations may help or hinder comprehension

---
class: inverse-orange middle
# String manipulations

---
# Reminder: base vs tidyverse
The tidyverse package is [{stringr}](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)

It is more consistent than base functions and occassionally faster

However, I tend to prefer the base functions, and they are still more commonly seen "in the wild" than **stringr**.

We'll therefore briefly cover both.

---
# Special characters

* `^`: Anchor - matches the start of a string
* `$`: Anchor - matches the end of a string
* `*`: Matches the preceding character **zero or more** times
* `?`: Matches the preceding character **zero or one** times
* `+`: Matches the preceding character **one or more** times
* `{`: Used to specify number of matches, `a{n}`, `a{n,}`, and `a{n, m}`
* `.`: Wildcard - matches any character
* `|`: OR operator
* `[`: Alternates, also used for character matching (e.g., `[:digit:]`)
* `(`: Used for backreferencing, look aheads, or groups
* `\`: Used to escape special characters

---
# More detail
Both of the below are good places to get more comprehensive information

* [RStudio cheatsheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/strings.pdf)

* [Regular expression](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html) vignette

# A few quick examples

Please follow along

```{r include = FALSE}
library(edld652)
d <- get_data("EDFacts_acgr_lea_2011_2019")
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(edld652)
d <- get_data("EDFacts_acgr_lea_2011_2019")
d
```

```{r}
d
```

---
# Challenge
### Do three things:

* Create a new variable that identifies if the LEA is associated with a city or a county

* Drop "City" or "County" from the LEA name (e.g., "Albertville City" would be "Albertville")

* Replace all `.` with `--DOT--` in `FILEURL` (so they are not actual links)

You'll need `base::gsub()` or `stringr::str_replace_all()`

`r countdown(5)`

---
# City or county

Ideas?

--

```{r echo = TRUE}
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(county = grepl("county$", tolower(LEANM)))
```


--

Another option

```{r echo = TRUE}
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(county = grepl("[Cc]ounty$", LEANM))
```


---
# Quick Check

```{r echo = TRUE}
d %>% 
  select(LEANM, county) %>% 
  print(n = 15)
```

---
# Remove city/county

* Lots of ways to do this. Use `base::gsub()` or `stringr::str_replace_all()`

* Replace everything after the space with nothing

--
```{r echo = TRUE}
d %>% 
  select(LEANM) %>% 
  mutate(new_name = gsub(" .+", "", LEANM))
```

--
You can also use `"\\s"` to mean "space"

---
# Another way
There are other ways too, of course

```{r echo = TRUE}
d %>% 
  select(LEANM) %>% 
  mutate(new_name = gsub(" City$| County$", "", LEANM))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(new_name = gsub(" .+", "", LEANM))
```

---
# Final step

Handling the URLs. This is a bit artificial, but it illustrates escaping, which is important.

* Remember `.` is a special character, so needs to be escaped

* `\` itself is a special character so it needs to be escaped. Functionally, then, you escape special characters with `\\`, not `\`.

---
```{r echo = TRUE}
d %>% 
  select(FILEURL) 
```

---
```{r echo = TRUE}
d %>% 
  select(FILEURL) %>% 
  mutate(FILEURL = gsub("\\.", "--DOT--", FILEURL)) %>% 
  as.data.frame()
```

---
# A few more examples

```{r echo = TRUE}
some_strings <- c("abc", "a23", "def", "Ad6")
```

--
Remove the digits

```{r echo = TRUE}
gsub("\\d", "", some_strings)
```

--
Extract the digits

```{r echo = TRUE}
gsub("\\D", "", some_strings)
```

---
Starts with A

```{r echo = TRUE}
grepl("^[aA]", some_strings)
```

---
# There's lots more

* Please checkout the vignette, in particular

* I end up using back-referencing a lot

--
```{r echo = TRUE}
cities <- c("Eugene, Oregon", "Denver, Colorado")
gsub(
  "^(.+), (.+)$", # pattern with two groupings
  "The state of \\2 includes the city of \\1", # reference the groups
  cities)

```

          aes_color, aes_lwd, aes_ltp,
          ncol = 3,

# Other elements to consider

* Text
  + How is the text displayed (e.g., font, face, location)? 
  + What is the purpose of the text?

--
* Transparency
  + Are there overlapping pieces? 
  + Can transparency help?

--
* Type of data
  + Continuous/categorical
  + Which can be mapped to each aesthetic?
    - e.g., shape and line type can only be mapped to categorical data, whereas
    color and size can be mapped to either.

# Scales
> A scale defines a unique mapping between data and aesthetics. Importantly, a scale must be one-to-one, such that for each specific data value there is exactly one aesthetics value and vice versa. If a scale isn't one-to-one, then the data visualization becomes ambiguous.

--

* Which data values correspond to specific aesthetic values?

class: middle center
# Basic Scales

```{r scales-wilke, fig.width = 14}
scale_num + scale_shape + scale_color + plot_layout(ncol = 1)
```

---
# Putting it to practice

```{r temp-change, fig.width = 14}
ggplot(temps_long, aes(x = date, y = temperature, color = location)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(name = "month", 
               limits = c(ymd("0000-01-01"), ymd("0001-01-04")),
               breaks = c(ymd("0000-01-01"), 
                          ymd("0000-04-01"), 
                          ymd("0000-07-01"),
                          ymd("0000-10-01"), 
                          ymd("0001-01-01")),

                     name = "temperature (¬∞F)") +
  scale_color_OkabeIto(order = c(1:3, 7), name = NULL) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 25) +
  theme(legend.title.align = 0.5)
```

---
# Basic code for previous plot

```{r echo = TRUE}
ggplot(temps_long, aes(date, temperature)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = location))
```


---
# Change colors
If you want to change the colors on the previous plot, you have to change the colors of the scale for the color mapping.

--

In other words, color is being mapped to data, and you have to change the color scale.

--

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(temps_long, aes(date, temperature)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = location)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

---
```{r }
ggplot(temps_long, aes(date, temperature)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = location)) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

---
# One more note on colors
There are lots of different scales and some work better than others. We'll talk about them more next week.


--
You **do not** use `scale_color_*()` if you are not mapping data to color


--
Make sure to keep straight `scale_color_*()` and `scale_fill_*()`

# Alternative representation
### Same plot as before, but with different scales

```{r temp-change2, fig.width = 14}

# Basic code for previous plot

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
temps_long %>% 
  group_by(location, month) %>% 
  summarize(temp = mean(temperature)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, location)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = temp),
            color = "white") +
  coord_fixed()
```

---
# Change the fill

```{r echo = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
temps_long %>% 
  group_by(location, month) %>% 
  summarize(temp = mean(temperature)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(month, location)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = temp),
            color = "white") +
  coord_fixed() +
  scico::scale_fill_scico(palette = "tokyo")

  + Two position scales (x/y axis)
  + One color scale (categorical for the first, continuous for the second)

# Minimize cognitive load
* Empirically, Tufte's plot was **the most difficult** for viewers to
interpret.


--
* Visual cues (labels, gridlines) *reduce* the data-ink ratio, but can also 
reduce cognitive load.

# Advice from Wilke

> Whenever possible, visualize your data with solid, colored shapes rather than with lines that outline those shapes. Solid shapes are more easily perceived, are less likely to create visual artifacts or optical illusions, and do more immediately convey amounts than do outlines.

.pull-left[
```{r iris_lines, fig.width = 6}

## This?

---
# The takeaway?
* It can often be helpful to remove "chart junk"
  + Remove background
  + Unnecessary frills
  + Certainly don't use 3D when it's not clearly warranted 


--
### But...

* Infographics can often be more memorable


---
# Compromise?
In some cases, it may be easy and more memorable to use glyphs instead of points or squares

--

* Install packages

```{r install_packages, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("extrafont")
remotes::install_github("wch/extrafontdb")
remotes::install_github("wch/Rttf2pt1")
remotes::install_github("hrbrmstr/waffle")
```

--

* Create data

```{r create_data, echo = TRUE}
parts <- c(`Un-breached\nUS Population` = (318 - 11 - 79), 
           `Premera` = 11,
           `Anthem` = 79)
```

---
# Basic plot

```{r waffle1, echo = TRUE}
library(waffle)
waffle(parts, 
       rows = 8, 
       colors = c("#969696", "#1879bf", "#009bda"))
```

---
# Glyph plot
Doesn't seem to work anymore...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

* Download and install `fontawesome-webfont.ttf` on your machine locally (see [here](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/))

* Import new fonts (including glyphs, via font awesome)

```{r import_fonts, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(extrafont)
font_import()
loadfonts()
```


```{r waffle2, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
waffle(parts/10, 
       rows = 3, 
       colors = c("#969696", "#1879bf", "#009bda"),
       use_glyph = "medkit") #<<
```

---
# Should look like this

Despite glyphs not (easily) working anymore, I still recommend you [check it out](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/waffle). It's a neat package and does have some integration with ggplot2 now.

# Not always a bad thing
> It is tempting to lay down inflexible rules about what to do in terms of producing your graphs, and to dismiss people who don‚Äôt follow them as producing junk charts or lying with statistics. But **being honest with your data is a bigger problem than can be solved by rules of thumb** about making graphs. In this case there is a moderate level of agreement that bar charts should generally include a zero baseline (or equivalent) given that bars encode their variables as lengths. But it would be a mistake to think that a dot plot was by the same token deliberately misleading, just because it kept itself to the range of the data instead.
