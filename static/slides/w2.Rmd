# Agenda 

.pull-left[
* Visualizing distributions
  + histograms
  + density plots
  + Empirical cumulative density plots
  + QQ plots
* Visualizing amounts
  + bar plots
  + dot plots
  + heatmaps
]

.pull-right[
* Working textual data
  + Splitting into words, n-grams
  + Visualizing word frequencies
* Cleaning string data
  + Substrings, basic transformations
  + Substitutions and quick pattern matching
]

--

A promise: You will have **at least 30 minutes** for lab, even if we have to pause this lecture early

---
# Learning Objectives

* Understand various ways the same underlying data can be displayed

* Think through pros/cons of each

* Understand the basic structure of the code to produce the various plots

* Create structured data from text and be able to visualize word frequencies

* Be able to replace patterns in strings and understand which character need to be "escaped"

* Kernal density estimation

  + Bandwidth matters most
  + Smaller bands = bend more to the data

* Approximation of the underlying continuous probability function
  + Integrates to 1.0 (y-axis is somewhat difficult to interpret)

# Extensions
We need to move on to other things, but we definitely would want to keep going here:

+ Order states according to something more meaningful (starting tuition, ending tuition, or difference in tuition)

+ Meaningful title, e.g., "Change in average tuition over a decade"

+ Consider better color scheme for points

+ Potentially color the difference line by magnitude

# Intro to textual data

## Disclaimer: 
This is going to be relatively fast, with not much depth. It's an intro, and I can work with you more individually if you end up working with text data.

---
# Structured vs unstructured

* Most every dataset you've ever worked with is what is referred to as a **structured** dataset - it has rows and columns.

* But there is an incredible amount of data out there that is **unstructured** - it just sort of exists


--
* Most text data is unstructured. How would you analyze the contents of a book? No rows or columns there

---
# Getting text data

There are **many** ways to get text data. Any digital text could potentially be used as textual data.


--
How about Wikipedia?


--
Anything that lives on the web is a common use case. Social media data being perhaps primary among them.

---
# "Screen" scraping
Short foray into web scraping. It's not expected you fully follow this. More about "exposure" and less about building competencies.

--

Use the [rvest](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/) package to scrape the data you see "on the screen".


--

Let's read in the Wikipedia page on Eugene

```{r message = FALSE}
library(rvest)
eugene <- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugene%2C_Oregon")
```

---
background-image:url(img/eugene-wiki.png)
background-size: contain

---
# Grab paragraphs
The `"#mw-content-text > div.mw-parser-output > p"` is the CSS selector that I pulled from the website
```{r }
paragraphs <- eugene %>% 
  html_elements("#mw-content-text > div.mw-parser-output > p") %>%
  html_text2()
```

The first paragraph is just an empty line, so they are numbered p + 1

Print the first paragraph

```{r }
cat(stringr::str_wrap(paragraphs[2], 50))
```

---
# Print the fourth paragraph

```{r }
cat(stringr::str_wrap(paragraphs[5], 50))
```

---
# Analysis
How do we analyze the text? What we we even analyze?


--
First, let's structure it! Turn the text into a simple data frame.

--
```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
eugene_df <- tibble(
  paragraph = seq_along(paragraphs),
  description = paragraphs
)
eugene_df
```

---
# Can we analyze it now?

Not really... what would we analyze?


--
Words!

Let's break it into words. This is where the [tidytext](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/) package comes into play.

---
# The `unnest_tokens()` function

Just like most functions in the tidyverse, we pipe our data to `unnest_tokens()`

* First argument is the name of the new column we want in our data

* Second argument is the text data to process

* Third argument is how the text should processed. The default is `"words"`, meaning the text will be broken into words.

---
# Example

```{r }
library(tidytext)
eugene_tidy_words <- eugene_df %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, description)
eugene_tidy_words
```

Not perfect, but pretty good

---
# What to do now?
Let's count some words!

```{r }
eugene_tidy_words %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

---
# Plot the top 15 words

```{r fig.height = 5}
eugene_tidy_words %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, n)) %>% 
  slice(1:15) %>% # select only the first 15 rows
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
    geom_col(fill = "cornflowerblue")
```

---
# Not very informative

## Why?

--
Most of the words are common words like "the", "and", "of" (top three words)


--
These are referred to as "stop words".


--
Luckily, **tidytext** provides us with a dictionary of stop words. We can use an `anti_join()` with this dictionary to remove these words.

---
# Quick refresher

A `semi_join()` works just like an `inner_join()`, but without adding any columns. A `semi_join()` works by **keeping** only rows that are in common with the two datasets.


--
An `anti_join()` does basically the opposite, by **removing** any rows that are in common between the two datasets.

---
# Look at the stop words
This dataset is available to you as soon as you load **tidytext**. 

There are three lexicons - I usually use all three.

```{r }
stop_words 
```

---
# Count
Let's try counting again without the stop words included.

.pull-left[

```{r }
eugene_tidy_words %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% #<<
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
```

]

.pull-right[
## So much more informative!
]

---
# Plot the top 15 words

```{r fig.height = 5}
eugene_tidy_words %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>% # make y-axis ordered by n
  slice(1:15) %>% # select only the first 15 rows
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
    geom_col(fill = "cornflowerblue")
```

---
# Add the headers in 
I hid the code here because it's weird and inefficient but the HTML structure made it difficult. You can look at the source if you want. The new dataframe is called `eugene_tidy_words2`.

```{r echo = FALSE}
h2 <- eugene %>% 
  html_elements("#mw-content-text > div.mw-parser-output > h2") %>% 
  html_text2()

headers <- purrr::map2(
  c("Intro", h2),
  c(3, 35, 9, 6, 13, 34, 11, 5, 9, 6, 5, 12, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0),
  ~rep(.x, .y)
) %>% 
  unlist()

headers <- gsub("\\[edit\\]", "", headers)

eugene_tidy_words2 <- eugene_df %>% 
  mutate(header = headers) %>% 
  select(paragraph, header, description)
eugene_tidy_words2
```

---
# Count words by header

Not surprisingly, "eugene" appears to be the most common among multiple categories.

We might want to remove "eugene" as well.

```{r }
eugene_tidy_words2 %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, description) %>% 
  count(header, word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words)
```

---
# Plot
Top 10 words by header

```{r }
p <- eugene_tidy_words2 %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, description) %>% 
  count(header, word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>% 
  group_by(header) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder_within(word, n, header)) %>% #<<
  ggplot(aes(n, word)) +
    geom_col(fill = "cornflowerblue") +
    scale_y_reordered() + #<<
    facet_wrap(~header, scales = "free_y", ncol = 3) 
```

# String manipulations

---
# Base vs tidyverse
The tidyverse package is [{stringr}](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/)

It is more consistent than base functions and occassionally faster

However, I tend to prefer the base functions, and they are still more commonly seen "in the wild" than **stringr**.

We'll therefore briefly cover both.

---
# Inconsistencies

Super common example

```{r }
set.seed(123)
ex <- tibble(
  gender = sample(
    c("f", "F", "Fem", "Female", "FEMALE", 
      "m", "M", "Male", "MALE",
      "nb", "NB", "non-binary", 
      "agender", "AGENDER", "Agender",
      "gender-fluid", "fluid",
      "No response"),
    500, 
    replace = TRUE),
  score = rnorm(500)
)
```

---
# Have vs want

.pull-left[
## Have
```{r echo = FALSE}
ex %>% 
  count(gender)
```
]

.pull-right[
## Want
```{r echo = FALSE}
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("fluid", gender), "fluid", gender),
    gender = ifelse(
      grepl("^n", gender) & gender != "no response", 
      "non-binary", 
      gender
    ),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^m", gender), "male", gender),
    gender = ifelse(
      grepl("^f", gender) & gender != "fluid", 
      "female", 
      gender
    ),
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```

# Walkthrough
Getting to what we want takes a few steps. Let's do it together!

---
# Consistent case
* The first thing we might want to do is change everything to uppercase or lowercase. This will fix many of our inconsistencies.

* Options are `stringr::str_to_upper()`, `stringr::str_to_lower()`, `base::toupper()` or `base::tolower()`


---
# Consistent case

.pull-left[
## Original
```{r }
ex %>% 
  count(gender)
```
]

.pull-right[
## Modified
```{r }
ex %>%
  mutate(gender = tolower(gender)) %>% 
  count(gender)
```

]

---
# What next?

--
Collapse the genders that have "fluid"? 


--
Use `grepl()` (global regular expression parser **l**ogical) with `ifelse()` to replace *if* a pattern is found


--
You could also use `stringr::str_detect()` instead. The arguments are just in reversed order

```{r eval = FALSE}
grepl("fluid", gender)
str_detect(gender, "fluid")
```

---
```{r }
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("fluid", gender), "gender-fluid", gender)
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```

---
# stringr

```{r }
library(stringr)
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(str_detect(gender, "fluid"), "gender-fluid", gender)
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```



---
# What next?

--
How about - if it starts with "m", then "Male"?


--
Use `"^"` to denote "starts with"


---

```{r }
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("fluid", gender), "gender-fluid", gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^m", gender), "male", gender)
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```


---
# Again
Replicate the same thing, but this time with "female". Note that we couldn't do this initially, but we can now because `"fluid"` has been collapsed with `"gender-fluid"`.

You try first

---
```{r }
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("fluid", gender), "gender-fluid", gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^m", gender), "male", gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^f", gender), "female", gender)
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```

---
# Again?
Can we do the same thing with `"^n"` for non-binary?


--
## NO!


--
Little bit more complicated - use Boolean logic.

---
```{r eval = FALSE}
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("fluid", gender), "gender-fluid", gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^m", gender), "male", gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^f", gender), "female", gender),
    gender = ifelse(
      grepl("^n", gender) & gender != "no response",
      "non-binary",
      gender
    )
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```

---
```{r echo = FALSE}
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("fluid", gender), "gender-fluid", gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^m", gender), "male", gender),
    gender = ifelse(grepl("^f", gender), "female", gender),
    gender = ifelse(
      grepl("^n", gender) & gender != "no response",
      "non-binary",
      gender
    )
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```

---
# stringr version

```{r eval = FALSE}
ex %>%
  mutate(
    gender = tolower(gender),
    gender = ifelse(str_detect(gender, "fluid"), "gender-fluid", gender),
    gender = ifelse(str_detect(gender, "^m"), "male", gender),
    gender = ifelse(str_detect(gender, "^f"), "female", gender),
    gender = ifelse(
      str_detect(gender, "^n") & gender != "no response",
      "non-binary",
      gender
    )
  ) %>% 
  count(gender)
```

# Special characters

* `^`: Anchor - matches the start of a string
* `$`: Anchor - matches the end of a string
* `*`: Matches the preceding character **zero or more** times
* `?`: Matches the preceding character **zero or one** times
* `+`: Matches the preceding character **one or more** times
* `{`: Used to specify number of matches, `a{n}`, `a{n,}`, and `a{n, m}`
* `.`: Wildcard - matches any character
* `|`: OR operator
* `[`: Alternates, also used for character matching (e.g., `[:digit:]`)
* `(`: Used for backreferencing, look aheads, or groups
* `\`: Used to escape special characters

# One more quick example

```{r }
library(edld652)
d <- get_data("EDFacts_acgr_lea_2011_2019")
d
```

---
# Do three things:

* Create a new variable that identifies if the LEA is associated with a city or a county

* Drop "City" or "County" from the LEA name (e.g., "Albertville City" would be "Albertville")

* Replace all `.` with `--DOT--` in `FILEURL` (so they are not actual links)


---
# City or county

Ideas?

--

```{r }
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(county = grepl("county$", tolower(LEANM)))
```

---
# Quick Check

```{r }
d %>% 
  select(LEANM, county) %>% 
  print(n = 15)
```

---
# Remove city/county

* Lots of ways to do this. Use `base::gsub()` or `stringr::str_replace_all()`

* Replace everything after the space with nothing

--
```{r }
d %>% 
  select(LEANM) %>% 
  mutate(new_name = gsub(" .+", "", LEANM))
```

---
# Another way
There are other ways too, of course

```{r }
d %>% 
  select(LEANM) %>% 
  mutate(new_name = gsub(" City$| County$", "", LEANM))
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
d <- d %>% 
  mutate(new_name = gsub(" .+", "", LEANM))
```

---
# Final step

Handling the URLs. This is a bit artificial, but it illustrates escaping, which is important.

* Remember `.` is a special character, so needs to be escaped

* `\` itself is a special character so it needs to be escaped. Functionally, then, you escape special characters with `\\`, not `\`.

---
```{r }
d %>% 
  select(FILEURL) 
```

---
```{r }
d %>% 
  select(FILEURL) %>% 
  mutate(FILEURL = gsub("\\.", "--DOT--", FILEURL)) %>% 
  as.data.frame()

```
