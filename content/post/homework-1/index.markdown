## Background
For this homework we will use data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). Kaggle is an online data science platform that began as a competitive platform for predictive modeling problems. Private organizations would offer a prize, usually in the range of $25K-$100K, for the individual or team that could provide the best predictive model for their problem. This is still a primary function of the website (see active competitions [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)), but the it has grown and is now also a place to share datasets, compete in *open* competitions (where you can see others code), and generally learn different facets and approaches to data science in an applied way.

### Getting Started
You can download the data we'll use for this homework either [from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rocki37/open-university-learning-analytics-dataset) (requires you create an account with Kaggle) or [directly from the organization](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset). The latter link is worth examining to learn more about the data, regardless.

A total of seven datasets (tables) related to an online learning analytics project should be included with your download. A number of keys link the various sources of data. I recommend reading through the documentation provided by the organization to better understand these keys.

## Assignment
The primary components of this assignment are highly open-ended. These are to

1. Use at least 3 mutating joins
2. Use at least 1 filtering join
3. Produce at least 3 data displays

Following the completion of these requirements, please reproduce the following figure.
